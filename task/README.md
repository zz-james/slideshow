* A text editor or IDE

Overview:

At the agreed start time for this task, we will push the task into this git repository. You will then have two hours to complete it and push your work back up to the github repository (in a branch). The task will involve you implementing a design we give you, using React.
Please make sure code is committed and pushed.

# Task

Use best practises and use a scalable architecture when implementing.
You will be implementing a sliding image gallery.

1. Create an image gallery component, whose design can be 
found in design.pdf file.
2. Add image sliding animations and button hover effect.
3. Implement gallery with an infinite stream of images, in a loop. 
When clicking the right arrow it would show images 01.jpg, 02.jpg, ... 09.jpg, 10.jpg, 01.jpg, 02.jpg ... etc.
4. Add 3 gallery components to the App.js component
5. When the user changes image in gallery, change it in other two galleries in a similar way.
(use any flux store for implementation) 
6. When finished create a new branch called "gallery" and push your changes
